I am archiving this repository due to the lack of motivation to update/continue this project due to OW2.

### Why?

I was preparing a big update (better mitigation to errors from Blizzard's API, better account setup, possible Youtube watching support), but for the past month OW2 news/announcements has been a killer to the motivation to continue this or to even play/support Overwatch. But now that everything has been revealed, it hit the nail in the coffin for me.

The switch to an extremely predatory monetization system without a good justification, the inability to grind to get all the skins, heroes locked behind excessive grind/money throwing away the level-playing field the game had (there is not even a way to one-time buy all new and future heroes) are some examples of the things I am not a fan of. Which is a shame because I really enjoyed playing the OW2 beta and I am certain that OW2 will be a good game gameplay-wise.

### Alternatives

You can still use this app as it will most likely keep working for the rest of the 2022 OWL season. **There are also alternatives to this app that perform the exact same thing on Github already**, so nothing is terribly lost here.
